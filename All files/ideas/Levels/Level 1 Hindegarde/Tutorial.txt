Sergeant Haffle:

Welcome to Hindegarde! 

What took you so long? 

Listen, I know you don't want to be here any more 
than we want you to be here but we're going to have 
to get along.

There's been bandits and highwaymen raiding our 
villagers ever since we received a threat from a
ruffian named Agzun. He's a brute from Andon, so 
he's big and as mean as they come. He came into town 
two months ago threatening to take our gold and grain
if we didn't pay him for protection. 

Now, we aren't interested in being exploited so we 
sent him on our way, but since then we've had 
villagers shook down for money and our crops have been
burned and several hogs slain. No one has been hurt 
yet but I fear it won't last.

Us Hindegardians are a tough lot, and we would handle 
things ourselves, but we've sent most of our fighting 
men to the Kingdom's wars, so we need help and you owe
us. 

We need to reclaim some of our mines so we can build
up a force to wipe these wretches out.

I'll introduce you to the men.
