1. You will need to introduce yourself to the 
troops and establish command.

2. Take them through a few manoeuvres so you

3. You need to secure the iron mines from the 
highwaymen across the bridge to help build up 
your forces.

4. You need to route out the ruins to rid them 
of their basecamp.

5. Since you've arrived, they have blocked off 
the pass, that is where Azgun is. We need his 
head on a pike.
